# File Finder Utility
This repository contains a simple file finder utility implemented in C. The utility mimics some functionalities of the find command available in Unix-like operating systems. It allows users to search for files in a specified directory and its subdirectories based on various criteria such as file name, modification time, inode number, and perform actions like deletion on the matched files.

### Compilation
To compile the utility, ensure you have gcc installed. Then, run the following command: `make`
